        <h2>Front-End & Back-End dev:</h2>
        <p>
          I excel in crafting visually appealing and responsive user interfaces
          using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am adept at leveraging popular
          front-end frameworks and libraries such as React.js to build dynamic
          and interactive user experiences. My commitment to creating intuitive
          and engaging designs is reflected in my attention to detail and
          dedication to the principles of responsive web design. Back-End
          Development: On the back-end, I have a strong command of server-side
          languages like Node.js and am skilled in designing and managing
          databases, including MySQL and MongoDB. I have experience developing
          robust and scalable server-side logic, ensuring the seamless
          integration of front-end and back-end functionalities.
